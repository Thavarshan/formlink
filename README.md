Formlink is inspired by Inertia.js's form helpers, but without the extra baggage. Designed specifically for traditional Laravel and Vue.js SPA applications, it simplifies form handling by removing unnecessary boilerplate. With Formlink, you get powerful form submission and validation helpers that integrate seamlessly with Laravel backend responses, offering all the essential features without the overhead. It's easy to use and takes care of the repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on building your application rather than writing boilerplate code.

Key Features:

- Reactive form data with Vue 3 support.
- Automatic CSRF token handling for Laravel.
- Simplified API with methods for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, and more.
- Error handling and validation integration with Laravel.
- File upload progress tracking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed:

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Install the Formlink package via npm:

   ```sh
   npm install formlink
   ```

2. Import Formlink in your Vue components:

   ```javascript
   import { useForm } from 'formlink';
   ```

3. Setup a form in your Vue component:

   ```javascript
   const form = useForm({
     name: '',
     email: '',
     message: ''
   });
   ```

## Usage

Formlink is a Vue composable for handling form data and submissions. Here's how you can use it with Vue:

### Basic Form Submission

```vue
<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="submitForm">
    <input v-model="form.name" type="text" placeholder="Name" />
    <input v-model="form.email" type="email" placeholder="Email" />
    <textarea v-model="form.message" placeholder="Your Message"></textarea>
    <button :disabled="form.processing" type="submit">Send</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
import { useForm } from 'formlink';

export default {
  setup() {
    const form = useForm({
      name: '',
      email: '',
      message: ''
    });

    const submitForm = async () => {
      try {
        await form.post('/contact');
        alert('Form submitted successfully');
      } catch (errors) {
        console.error('Form submission failed:', form.errors);
      }
    };

    return { form, submitForm };
  }
};
</script>
```

### Handling Errors and Validations

Formlink integrates with Laravel validation responses, automatically capturing errors.

```vue
<p v-if="form.errors.name">{{ form.errors.name }}</p>
```

### Progress Handling for File Uploads

```vue
<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="uploadFile">
    <input type="file" @change="handleFileChange" />
    <p v-if="form.progress">{{ form.progress.percentage }}% uploaded</p>
    <button :disabled="form.processing" type="submit">Upload</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
import { useForm } from 'formlink';

export default {
  setup() {
    const form = useForm({
      file: null
    });

    const handleFileChange = (e) => {
      form.data.file = e.target.files[0];
    };

    const uploadFile = async () => {
      await form.post('/upload', {
        onProgress: (progress) => {
          console.log(progress);
        }
      });
    };

    return { form, handleFileChange, uploadFile };
  }
};
</script>
```
