## [Unreleased](https://github.com/Thavarshan/formlink/compare/v1.2.6...HEAD)

## [v1.2.6](https://github.com/Thavarshan/formlink/compare/v1.2.5...v1.2.6) - 2025-04-08

### Added

- **Utility Abstractions**: Introduced several utility functions to improve modularity and testability:
  
  - `createFormProxy` (moved proxy logic out of class)
  - `deepClone` (replaces internal `deepClone` method)
  - `prepareSubmissionData` (encapsulates data transformation and file handling logic)
  - `getDefaultHeaders` (extracts CSRF token header logic)
  - `createProgressObject` (standardizes upload progress structure)
  - `formatGeneralError` and `formatValidationErrors` (modular error formatting)
  - `createTimeout` (abstracts timeout creation)
  
- **Debounce Time Configuration**: Added optional `debounceTime` parameter to `submitDebounced` method for customizable delay duration.
  

### Changed

- **Proxy Creation**: Replaced inline proxy logic within the constructor with `createFormProxy()` helper.
- **Deep Cloning**: Refactored cloning logic to use the `deepClone()` utility instead of a private method.
- **Data Preparation**: Moved data transformation and file handling into `prepareSubmissionData()`.
- **Header Management**: Extracted CSRF token header logic into `getDefaultHeaders()`.
- **Progress Tracking**: Refactored `updateProgress` to use `createProgressObject()` for standardized formatting.
- **Error Handling**: Replaced inline error formatting with `formatValidationErrors()` and `formatGeneralError()` for better readability and separation of concerns.
- **Timeout Management**: Switched from `window.setTimeout` to `createTimeout()` for better control and consistency.
- **Cleaner Disposal**: Updated `dispose()` to use `Object.keys().forEach()` for better clarity and reliability when clearing object keys.

### Fixed

- **Potential Proxy Redundancy**: Improved property fallback logic by moving proxy logic out, reducing chances of conflicts or duplication.
- **Error Object Casting**: Made error response casting and fallback more robust using type-safe utilities.
- **Form Reset Edge Cases**: Fixed edge case where resetting with specific fields might not deep clone defaults properly.
- **Timeout Cleanup**: Ensured all timeouts (including debounce) are properly cleared in all scenarios, improving memory safety.
